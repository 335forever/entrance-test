# entrance-test
In task 1 and 2, I used Javascript and Jest to code functions and unit tests, run "npm test" to check the results

In task 3, i use Redux to control the posts list data as well as 2 methods GET and POST. the main functions will be:
- Preload some initial posts
- Each post component has the ability to change new content with a button
- Table of contents for posts
- Form to create new posts
- Try demo: [ByVercel](https://entrance-test-kappa.vercel.app/)
